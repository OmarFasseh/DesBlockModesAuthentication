# DesBlockModesAuthentication
DES Block Modes with Authentication

## Important note
This was created using winsock2 so you'll need windows to run both the sender and receiver :/


## How to run
run the .exe if you don't need to compile

or to compile and run
 run `runReceiver.bat` and `runSender.bat` for sender and receiver
 run `runDesAnalysis.bat` for the blockmodes benchmarking. 

you can change config.txt after it's generated by the sender and the receiver will read the new values (which will be wrong ofc)
